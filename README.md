Pantry Plus - Coding Temple Software Engineering Graduate capstone project.

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, SQLite, Jinja 2, JSON, Spoonacular API, Postman, Virtual Environment

Developed a full-stack web application for recipe management using Flask backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend, facilitating users to search recipes, find by ingredients, create a personal menu, and play a random recipe game
Implemented user authentication system, allowing only signed-in users to access features beyond the homepage such as current menu search, find by ingredients, database search, and Recipe Roulette

Leveraged Spoonacular API to fetch and update missing information dynamically as users interact with the search features, enhancing application data accuracy and user experience
Established a robust testing environment using Postman and a virtual environment, facilitating extensive application testing and bug identification
Applied pagination to handle large search results efficiently, displaying 100 results into 4 groups of 25 each, enhancing user navigation experience
Programmed application to add new recipes to the database as they are discovered, incrementally expanding the available options for users

Future Plans:

Plan to implement a React frontend and Postgres SQL backend to handle larger recipe loads; managed to accumulate over 2000 recipes during daily random food searches
Intend to continue refining and expanding the application as part of the continuous learning journey post the completion of the Coding Temple software engineer boot camp
Personal Note:

As a recent graduate of Coding Temple's software engineering boot camp, I am committed to continuous learning and refining my skills. I am passionate about coding and am excited about the journey ahead. I look forward to furthering my experience and learning new technologies, starting with furthering my knowledge of React and Postgres SQL.
